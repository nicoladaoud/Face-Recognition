# Face-Recognition
A program that uses Tensorflow and Keras to create a face recognition system. I did this as an assignment for my
deep learning specialization throug coursera and deeplearning.ai.
Project outcomes:
1. Greatly improve my Tensorflow and Keras knowledge.
2. Learned to implemement state of the art deep learning software using popular libraries.
3. Improved my deep learning skills.
